### Hello ğŸ‘‹

I am Rasmus. I love coding in JavaScript, React, CSS and HTML. 
I have lived and worked in multiple countries, including Germany where he has undertaken tasks for companies such as Rocket Internet and PUMA.

Fun fact, I have done 40 push-ups every day for the last 15 years. Thatâ€™s 219,000 push-ups in total!!ğŸ’ªğŸ’ª
